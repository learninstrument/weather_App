# Fix Vercel 404 Deployment Issue

## Tasks
- [ ] Refactor server.js to export a Vercel-compatible handler function
- [ ] Update vercel.json if needed
- [ ] Test the refactored server locally
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel and verify fix

## Current Issue
- server.js creates an HTTP server but Vercel expects a serverless function handler
- All requests are routed to server.js but it doesn't export the correct interface

## Solution
- Convert server.js to export a handler function that Vercel can call
- Maintain existing static file serving and API endpoint functionality
