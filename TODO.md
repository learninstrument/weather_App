# Weather App Vercel Deployment Fix

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyze the Vercel deployment issue
- [x] Identify the bug in server.js static file serving logic
- [x] Fix the '/public/' route handling in server.js

## Next Steps
- [ ] Commit and push the changes to your repository
- [ ] Redeploy the application on Vercel
- [ ] Test that CSS, JS, and images load properly on the deployed site
- [ ] Verify weather API functionality works correctly

## Issue Summary
The problem was in the static file serving logic where `/public/` routes were incorrectly processed by removing the leading slash, causing file paths to be malformed (e.g., 'publicstyle.css' instead of 'public/style.css').

## Fix Applied
Changed `serveStaticFile(res, pathname.substring(1))` to `serveStaticFile(res, pathname)` in the '/public/' route handler to preserve the correct file path.
